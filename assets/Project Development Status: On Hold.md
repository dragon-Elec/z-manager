Notice as of: Oct 10, 2025

Development on the Z-Manager project is currently on hold. This decision is based on a critical incompatibility discovered between a core desired feature—persistent ZRAM writeback—and the capabilities of the primary target operating system, Zorin OS 17.3 (based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS "Jammy Jellyfish").
this is not all there are many other things that will make project its own standred lib. bassed on this fact alone i have decided to hlat the devlopment for 22 LTS. i all i can do is to only enable thigns for 22 LTS that are comptaible. a non standered last package will be realased that will disable writeback and other problamatic features. 

Proceeding with development under this limitation would require implementing a non-standard, brittle workaround that violates the project's goal of being a robust and reliable system utility that integrates cleanly with standard OS components
