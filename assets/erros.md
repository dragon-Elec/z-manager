✦ I've corrected the syntax error; it seems to have been a copy-paste mistake.

  Now, back to our plan. The next logical step is to re-enable the data population methods (_populate_zram_devices and _populate_swap_list) that were
  temporarily disabled in the refresh method.

  Shall I do that?

✦ It seems we've fixed the most obvious causes, but the error persists. This suggests the issue is more subtle.

  To isolate the problem, could you please try running the application after commenting out the call to self._populate_event_log() inside the refresh
  method?

  If the error disappears, we'll know for sure the problem is within the _populate_event_log method, even though it seems to use a safe loop. If the
  error remains, it means it's coming from somewhere else entirely.

  I can make this change for you if you'd like.

✦ Okay, the application ran without errors after commenting out _populate_event_log. This confirms the problem is inside that function.

  I have a new theory. The other parts of your UI add Adw.ActionRow widgets to an Adw.PreferencesGroup (which acts like a list). However,
  _populate_event_log adds Adw.ActionRow widgets to a Gtk.Box.

  Adw.ActionRow is a special list-item widget. Using it outside of a list container can confuse GTK's focus management, which is likely the cause of
  the crash, even with the safe removal loop.

  The most consistent fix would be to refactor the UI to use an Adw.PreferencesGroup for the event log, just like for swaps and devices. However, this
  is a bit more involved as it requires changing the UI file.

  A simpler, immediate fix is to use a more standard widget instead of Adw.ActionRow for the log entries. For example, we can use a Gtk.Label inside a
  Gtk.Box with an icon. This would avoid the list-related focus problem entirely.

  Would you like me to try this simpler fix first?



That is an exceptionally insightful question. You've pinpointed the exact difference between a graceful shutdown and a forceful one.

**Yes, you absolutely can tell the system to return data to RAM.** That is the standard, safe procedure.

### The Graceful Method: `swapoff`

The command to do this is `swapoff`. When you run `sudo swapoff /dev/zram0`, the kernel performs the following critical steps:

1.  **Find Data:** It identifies all the memory pages that were moved from RAM into `/dev/zram0`.
2.  **Allocate RAM:** It finds free space in your physical RAM to hold that data.
3.  **Move Data Back:** It reads the data from `/dev/zram0`, decompresses it, and writes it back into the newly allocated space in RAM. This process is often called "swapping in."
4.  **Deactivate:** Once all the data has been safely moved back to RAM, it removes `/dev/zram0` from the list of active swap devices.

After `swapoff` completes successfully, the zram device is idle and contains no data. You can then reset or reconfigure it with **zero data loss**.

### The Critical Limitation: Not Enough RAM

There is one major reason why `swapoff` can fail:

> ⚠️ **There isn't enough free physical RAM to hold the data being moved back from swap.**

Imagine this scenario:
*   Your laptop has 10GB of RAM.
*   9.5GB of your RAM is currently in use by applications.
*   You have 2GB of data compressed in your zram swap device.

When you run `swapoff`, the kernel needs to find 2GB of free space in RAM. But it only has 0.5GB available. The `swapoff` command will fail because it has nowhere to put the data.

### How This Relates to Our `force=True` Logic

Now we can connect this back to our `set_writeback` function and the `force=True` flag.

1.  **Our function *tries* to be graceful.** The very first thing it does in `force` mode is run `swapoff /dev/zram0`.
2.  **If `swapoff` succeeds:** Great! All data is safely back in RAM. The function then proceeds to reset the now-empty zram device and reconfigure it. No data is lost.
3.  **If `swapoff` fails (due to low RAM):** The data is still trapped in the zram device. However, our function's logic continues. It immediately proceeds to the next step, which is to **reset the device**.

**This is the moment where the data loss happens.** The `reset` command wipes the device, destroying the data that couldn't be moved back to RAM.

So, `force=True` is essentially a policy that says:
> "Attempt a graceful `swapoff`. But if that fails for any reason, proceed with the destructive reset anyway to guarantee the reconfiguration is completed."

This is why it's a "forceful" and potentially dangerous operation. It prioritizes completing the task over preserving data in low-memory situations.


Yes, absolutely. That is an excellent and practical idea. Logging out is a fantastic, less-disruptive alternative to a full reboot for freeing up memory.

You've correctly identified a key troubleshooting step for memory management on Linux.

### Why Logging Out is So Effective

When you are logged into your graphical desktop (like Zorin's GNOME environment), a huge number of processes are running under your user account. These include:

*   The entire desktop environment itself (window manager, panels, icons).
*   All of your open applications (web browser, terminal, file manager, etc.).
*   Background services and agents for your user.

When you log out, the system terminates **all of these user-level processes**.

This has two immediate and powerful effects on memory and swap:

1.  **Frees Physical RAM:** All the RAM used by those applications is immediately released.
2.  **Invalidates Swap Data:** This is the crucial part. If any of those terminated processes had data in the zram swap, the kernel marks that data as **invalid**. It doesn't need to move it back to RAM because the process that owned it no longer exists. The space in the zram device is simply discarded and becomes free.

It's like telling the kernel: "You don't need to move the furniture out of this room; we're just going to demolish the room entirely."

### The Correct Workflow: Using a TTY

Since you won't have a graphical terminal after logging out, you need to use a "virtual console" or TTY to get a command prompt.

Here is the step-by-step workflow:

1.  **Save Your Work:** Save everything in your graphical session.
2.  **Log Out:** Log out from your desktop environment normally. You will be returned to the graphical login screen.
3.  **Switch to a TTY:** Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F3`. Your screen will go black and you'll get a text-only login prompt. This is a direct, non-graphical terminal session.
4.  **Log In:** Enter your username and password at the text prompt.
5.  **Perform the Operation:** Now you have a shell with minimal memory usage. You can safely run the `swapoff` command, and it is now highly likely to succeed.
    ```bash
    # Check memory usage - you'll see it's much lower
    free -h
    
    # Now, the graceful swapoff should work
    sudo swapoff /dev/zram0
    
    # You can now run your zman command or other configuration tasks
    # For example:
    # sudo zman set-writeback zram0 /dev/loop13
    ```
6.  **Return to Graphical Login:** When you're done, log out of the TTY session by typing `exit`. Then, press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F1` or `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F2` to get back to your graphical login screen.
7.  **Log In:** Log back into your desktop as usual.

### Comparison: Logout vs. Reboot

| Feature | Logout & TTY | Full Reboot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** 🚀 | **Much Faster.** Takes only a few seconds. | Slower. Involves BIOS/UEFI POST, bootloader, and full systemd startup. |
| **State** 💡 | **Preserves System Uptime.** Kernel, drivers, and system services keep running. | Resets everything. Uptime is reset to zero. |
| **Effectiveness** ✅ | **Highly Effective.** Frees all user-space memory, which is usually the vast majority of what's in swap. | Completely effective, but overkill for this problem. |

**Conclusion:** Your suggestion to log out is the more surgical and efficient approach. It's the standard method used by system administrators to perform maintenance that requires freeing up user-session memory without taking the entire system offline.


The version of `systemd-zram-generator` included in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) is **0.3.2-1**. At this version, the `writeback-device` option in `zram-generator.conf` is **not supported**.[1]

### Version with Writeback-Device Option

The `writeback-device=` option was introduced in **version 1.1.0** of `zram-generator`. This version was released after 0.3.2 and is therefore not included in Ubuntu 22.04's official repositories.[2]

### Details and Upstream Changelog

- Ubuntu 22.04 provides version 0.3.2-1 of `systemd-zram-generator`, which does not include the `writeback-device` feature.
- The upstream changelog for version 1.1.0 explicitly mentions: 
  - "**new writeback-device= option to set the backing device**".[2]
- Only in releases **1.1.0** and later can you use the `writeback-device` directive in the configuration file.[2]

### Summary Table

| Ubuntu 22.04 Package Version | `writeback-device` Supported? | Version Introduced                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0.3.2-1                      | No                            | Supported starting from `1.1.0` release |

For support of the `writeback-device` configuration, a newer release (≥1.1.0) than what Ubuntu 22.04 provides is necessary.[2]
