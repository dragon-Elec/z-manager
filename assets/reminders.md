_read_sys_file() / _write_sys_file(): ⚠️ This is a problem. This module has its own private, duplicate functions for reading and writing system files. It should be using the official, robust ones from our system.py (or os_utils.py) core file.
Relationship to Honeycomb: It should be using system.py for all its file I/O, but it currently doesn't.

Assessment: 🔶 Functionally Sound, but Inefficient. It works, but it violates the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle by having its own file I/O logic. This makes maintenance harder.

Action Required: Refactor. Replace the internal _read_sys_file and _write_sys_file functions with calls to the public functions in system.py.

Excellent question. It's important to understand the "why" behind each major change.

We refactored the writeback logic for one simple reason: **compatibility.**

The original method crashed on your system. The new method works everywhere.

### The Problem in Detail

The original code tried to set the writeback device using a command-line flag, like this:

`zramctl /dev/zram0 --size 4G --writeback-device /dev/loop13`

When we ran this, your system's `zramctl` immediately failed with the error:

`zramctl: unrecognized option '--writeback-device'`

This error was the key. It told us that the version of the `zram-tools` package on your system (Ubuntu Jammy) is older and simply does not understand the `--writeback-device` flag. It's a feature that was added in a newer version.

### The Solution: Using a Universal Method

We needed a way to set the writeback device that would work on **all** systems, both old and new.

The research (and the `zram-generator.conf.md` document) revealed that the Linux kernel itself provides a universal way to do this through the `sysfs` filesystem. Any system that supports zram writeback has a special control file located at:

`/sys/block/zram0/backing_dev`

By writing a device path (like `/dev/loop13`) directly into this file, we command the kernel to set the writeback device. This method doesn't depend on the version of `zramctl`; it depends only on the kernel, making it far more reliable and universal.

### Summary Table: Old vs. New Method

| Feature                  | Old Method (`zramctl` flag)             | New Method (`sysfs` write)                                  |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mechanism**            | A command-line argument for a tool      | Writing directly to a kernel control file                   |
| **Compatibility**        | ❌ **Modern `zram-tools` only**           | ✅ **Universal** (works on all systems with zram writeback) |
| **Result on Your System**  | **Crash** (`unrecognized option`)       | **Success**                                                 |
| **Our Application's Choice** | Abandoned                             | **Implemented**                                             |

**In short:** We switched from a version-specific command that was breaking the application to a universal kernel feature that is guaranteed to work. This change was a necessary fix to ensure the application is robust and compatible.


However, our research and testing have proven that this ideal is not the reality.

The reality is that zramctl is an imperfect and inconsistent tool:

    Its --reset function is destructive and undocumented.

    Its --writeback-device flag doesn't even exist on your system.

    It has strict, undocumented rules about the order of operations.

Conclusion: The benefit of using zramctl is purely theoretical. In practice, it's an unreliable abstraction. The only way to build a robust application is to bypass the unreliable parts of zramctl and talk directly to the kernel's sysfs interface, which has consistent and predictable rules.
