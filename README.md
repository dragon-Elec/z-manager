## About The Project

Z-Manager is a user-friendly desktop application designed to simplify the configuration and monitoring of ZRAM on modern Linux systems. It acts as a graphical frontend for `zram-generator` and the `zramctl` utility, removing the need to manually edit configuration files in the terminal.

This tool is for desktop users and system tweakers who want to harness the performance benefits of ZRAM without the command-line hassle.

## Features

*   **Easy Configuration:** Configure ZRAM size, compression algorithm, and swap priority through a simple interface.
*   **Advanced Settings:** Manage advanced `zram-generator` options like writeback devices, filesystem mode, and host memory limits.
*   **Configuration Profiles:** Use built-in profiles (e.g., "Desktop / Gaming") for quick and optimized setups.
*   **Live Monitoring:** View real-time statistics for active ZRAM devices, including usage, compression ratio, and memory statistics.
*   **System Health:** Get a clear overview of your entire system's swap configuration and diagnose potential conflicts (like an active ZSwap).
*   **System Tuning:** Adjust related kernel parameters like CPU governors and I/O schedulers to further optimize performance.
*   **Log Viewer:** Easily view ZRAM-related logs from the systemd journal to troubleshoot issues.

## Bugs

*   **Bug 1:** zramctl- scrambled data
```py
>>> from core import zdevice_ctl
>>> devices = zdevice_ctl.list_devices()
>>> print(devices)
[DeviceInfo(name='zram0', disksize='lzo-rle', data_size='4G', compr_size='4K', ratio=None, streams='12K', algorithm='4')]
>>>
```

*   **Bug 2:** Description of bug 2.

## Installation

Installation instructions will be provided once the application reaches a more stable release.
