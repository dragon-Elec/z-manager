NAME         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume@.service, systemd-hibernate-resume -
       Resume from hibernation

SYNOPSIS         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume@.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-hibernate-resume

DESCRIPTION         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume@.service initiates the resume from
       hibernation. It is instantiated with the device to resume from as
       the template argument.

       systemd-hibernate-resume only supports the in-kernel hibernation
       implementation, see Swap suspend[1]. Internally, it works by
       writing the major:minor of specified device node to
       /sys/power/resume.

       Failing to initiate a resume is not an error condition. It may
       mean that there was no resume image (e. g. if the system has been
       simply powered off and not hibernated). In such case, the boot is
       ordinarily continued.
