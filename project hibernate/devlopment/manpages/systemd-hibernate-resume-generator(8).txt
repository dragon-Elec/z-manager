NAME         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume-generator - Unit generator for resume=
       kernel parameter

SYNOPSIS         top

       /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-hibernate-resume-generator

DESCRIPTION         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume-generator is a generator that initiates
       the procedure to resume the system from hibernation. When resume=
       kernel command line option or HibernateLocation EFI variable is
       detected, it enables the systemd-hibernate-resume.service(8) unit,
       which will instruct the kernel to resume the system from the
       hibernation image.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume-generator understands the following
       kernel command line parameters:

       resume=
           Takes a path to the resume device. Both persistent block
           device paths like /dev/disk/by-foo/bar and fstab(5)-style
           specifiers like "FOO=bar" are supported.

           Added in version 217.

       resume_offset=
           Takes the page offset of the swap space from the resume
           device. Defaults to "0".

           Added in version 254.

       resumeflags=
           Takes the resume device mount options to use. Defaults
           rootflags= if not specified.

           Added in version 243.

       noresume
           Do not try to resume from hibernation. If this parameter is
           present, resume= is ignored.

           Added in version 240.
