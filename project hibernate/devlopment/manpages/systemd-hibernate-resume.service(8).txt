NAME         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume.service, systemd-hibernate-clear.service,
       systemd-hibernate-resume - Resume from hibernation

SYNOPSIS         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume.service

       systemd-hibernate-clear.service

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-hibernate-resume

DESCRIPTION         top

       systemd-hibernate-resume.service initiates the resume from
       hibernation.

       systemd-hibernate-resume only supports the in-kernel hibernation
       implementation, see Swap suspend[1]. Internally, it works by
       writing the major:minor of selected device node to
       /sys/power/resume, along with the offset in memory pages
       (/sys/power/resume_offset) if supported.

       The resume device node is either passed directly through
       arguments, or automatically acquired from kernel command line
       options and/or HibernateLocation EFI variable. The latter will
       normally be cleared by systemd-hibernate-resume.service on
       resumption. If a stale variable is detected, it would be cleared
       by systemd-hibernate-clear.service.

       Failing to initiate a resume is not an error condition. It may
       mean that there was no resume image (e. g. if the system has been
       simply powered off and not hibernated). In such cases, the boot is
       ordinarily continued.
