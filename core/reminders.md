_read_sys_file() / _write_sys_file(): ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a problem. This module has its own private, duplicate functions for reading and writing system files. It should be using the official, robust ones from our system.py (or os_utils.py) core file.
Relationship to Honeycomb: It should be using system.py for all its file I/O, but it currently doesn't.

Assessment: üî∂ Functionally Sound, but Inefficient. It works, but it violates the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle by having its own file I/O logic. This makes maintenance harder.

Action Required: Refactor. Replace the internal _read_sys_file and _write_sys_file functions with calls to the public functions in system.py.

Summary Table of Opportunities
Library	Replaces...	Benefit	Complexity	Recommendation
python3-systemd	Manual journalctl parsing	High (Data Quality)	Low	‚úÖ Already Done (Good!)
psutil	Manual parsing of /proc files	Medium (Robustness)	Low	Strongly Recommended. This would be a great next step for improving health.py.
pyudev	Static device checks	High (Dynamic UI)	Medium	A good idea for a future "version 2.0" feature.
dbus-python	systemctl subprocess calls	High (Integration)	High	Overkill for now, but the "gold standard" for deep integration.
